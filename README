pyvolwheel v0.1.0

Description
===========
pyvolwheel is a python application that puts an icon in your system tray from
which you can control the volume using your mouse wheel or optional hot-keys.
It is compatible with both ALSA and OSS and supports muting for controls that
don't natively support it. pyvolwheel can also remember the volume level when
it quits and restore it the next time it starts.
